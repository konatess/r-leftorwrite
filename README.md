# r-leftorwrite

## Other features we do not currently have, but would like to, include:

### Important:
* Age restrictions for warned content.
* Banning users and user abuse reporting.
* Readers bookmarking pages of any story to return to later. Cluster bookmarks by story.
* Favorite Authors list for readers.
* Beta readers features, including a built in option for betas to leave feedback.
* The ability to share stories with certain readers without making them public on the site, possibly via a special link.

### Fun:
* Tracking for most popular stories by how often they are read.
* Rating of stories 1-5 stars by readers.
* Adding visuals so that authors can create graphic novels.
* Adding variables to a story which can contain reader input, or track change based on the reader's choices.
* Statistical analysis of readers choices for writers: which paths are followed most often and which choices are most popular, and potentially even whether the choice of branch affects the reader's rating of the story overall.
* Co-writing of stories or branches of a story, and guest authoring of certain passages or branches.
* Color schemes both for writers while they are writing, and so that writers can set a mood for their readers.
